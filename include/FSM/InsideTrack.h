 * @details  Handles the driving when the car is within track limits, which mean that the the
 *           sensors track wil return values > 0 inside the track. This state is responsible
 *           for any event that occur inside the track including curves and straightline tracks.
 * 
 * @param start_gear the gear used at the begining of the race
 * @param low_gear_limit Threshlod to bound low gears.
 * @param low_rpm Threshlod of rpm to delimit the change of low gears.
 * @param average_rpm Threshlod to decrease high gears.
 * @param high_rpm Threshlod to increase high gears.
 * @param base_speed Proportionality between highest value read by range finders and TARGET SPEED.
 * @param speed_factor Lowest speed allowed.
